### 1. ะก++

An example of a data structure project is a dynamic array. It is efficient in terms of memory usage because it only constructs objects when needed. In doing so, it also meets a strict security guarantee.

### 2. Algorithms

An example of an algorithm is the GrahamScan algorithm that constructs the lowest convex hull for a set of given points.
